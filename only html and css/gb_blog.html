					<p> We're ready to announce that the 2nd edition of RubyConf Portugal is coming and it's going to be bigger, bolder and awesome-er! </p> 
					<p>A long time passed since the day that we decided to create the very first RubyConf Portugal. Since then we worked tirelessly to make sure that, with the first edition, we'd build the foundations for a consistent yearly conference about Ruby in Portugal. By the reactions from speakers and attendees, it seems we've hit a home run:</p>
					<p>Again this year, this is an event envisioned by Group Buddies, although everyone is invited to help us put it together. We want to join forces and unite the community, in order to create the best event we possibly can.</p>

					<p>I said it before and I'll say it again, several times: Automation is awesome. </p> 
					<p>I previously showed an example of how you can automate the whole process of merging pull requests. Now I'd like to share another git tip that helps me speed up my workflow. This one is about git hooks. </p>
					<p>What are git hooks?</p>
					<p>A git hook is a script that gets triggered automatically when certain events happen (e.g. when creating a new commit). 
						Now you're probably remembering that Github has something similar, called Webhooks. Those are the things that trigger your Travis CI builds every time you push a new commit (that's just one example of the many integrations Github provides). 
						While those are great for their purpose, git itself has its own hooks that you can use to your advantage in your local copy of a repository.</p>

					<h2> Knowing your users </h2>
					<p>I previously showed an example of how you can automate the whole process of merging pull requests. Now I'd like to share another git tip that helps me speed up my workflow. This one is about git hooks. </p>
					<p>What are git hooks?</p>
					<p>A person can have a hard time using your product for a multitude of reasons, from being blind to having a motor disability or even being new to technology. Research is key at this point. How many users do you have? How many of them are not able to use your site? Is it an internal tool, or a product for the masses? When in doubt don't make assumptions. Try to be as inclusive as possible and feasible in your time frame. The stage of the product is also a factor in this. Building a prototype, an MVP or improving an area of a website used by millions of people daily, have very different constraints and also very different amounts of information available about the target audience. In my opinion, there is no excuse for at least having this in mind in the conceptual stage of your product.</p>
