                    <p>We're  ready  to  announce  that  the  2nd  edition  of  <a  href="http://rubyconf.pt/">RubyConf  Portugal</a>  is  coming  and  it's  going  to  be  bigger,  bolder  and  awesome-er!</p>
                    <p>A  long  time  passed  since  the  day  that  we  decided  to  create  the  <a  href="https://blog.groupbuddies.com/posts/31-brace-yourselves-rubyconf-portugal-is-coming">very  first</a>  RubyConf  Portugal.  Since  then  we  worked  tirelessly  to  make  sure  that,  with  the  first  edition,  we'd  build  the  foundations  for  a  consistent  yearly  conference  about  Ruby  in  Portugal.  By  the  reactions  from  speakers  and  attendees,  it  seems  we've  hit  a  home  run:</p>

                    <%=  image_tag("t2.png")  %>
                    <script  async=""  src="./Group  Buddies  Blog_files/widgets.js"  charset="utf-8"></script>
                    <p>Again  this  year,  this  is  an  event  envisioned  by  <a  href="https://groupbuddies.com/">Group  Buddies</a>,  although  everyone  is  invited  to  help  us  put  it  together.  We  want  to  join  forces  and  unite  the  community,  in  order  to  create  the  best  event  we  possibly  can.</p>
                    <h1>Where?</h1>
                    <p>The  conference  will  again  take  place  in  the  beautiful  city  of  Braga,  Portugal's  third  biggest  city,  with  an  amazing  history  and  a  fantastic  University.  It  was  the  European  Youth  Capital  in  2012  and  it  is  30  mins  away  from  Porto,  the  <a  href="https://www.europeanbestdestinations.org/top/europe-best-destinations-2014">coolest  city  of  Europe</a>.  You  probably  already  heard  of  it,  at  least  about  the  Port  Wine  and  the  <a  href="https://www.ana.pt/en-US/Topo/institucional/aboutANA/News/News/Pages/Porto-Airport-once-again-voted-3rd-best-in-Europe.aspx">OPO  airport</a>  (which,  by  the  way,  was  also  considered  one  of  the  best  in  Europe).</p>
                    <p>Braga  can  be  described  as  an  ancient,  historic  city,  filled  with  young  people,  determined  to  make  a  difference.  We  have  great  tech  companies  here,  with  major  international  relevance,  as  well  as  young  companies  and  startups.</p>
                    <h1>When?</h1>
                    <p>This  year  it  will  happen  on  September  13  to  15.</p>
                    <h1>CFP,  Tickets,  and  more...</h1>
                    <p>We  will  soon  be  launching  the  Call  For  Proposals  and  we  will  start  selling  tickets  next  month.  Sponsors  and  partners  are  welcome,  so  we'd  love  if  you  could  help  us  spread  the  word.  We  will  have  a  team  of  voluntaries  which  you  can  apply  for,  by  emailing  us  at  <a  href="mailto:rubyconfpt@groupbuddies.com">rubyconfpt@groupbuddies.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>We  are  aware  of  the  challenge  that  it  represents  to  top  last  year's  edition.  Creating  such  an  ambitious  conference  is  far  from  being  an  easy  task,  but  we're  confident  that  the  portuguese  ruby  community  will  again  embrace  this  event  as  a  way  to  unite  itself  and  put  Portugal  on  the  map,  not  only  amongst  ruby  conferences,  but  also  amongst  the  OSS  community  in  general.</p>
                    <p>We  hope  to  see  you  all  this  fall  in  Braga.</p>
