    <h2 class="h1-article">Game On! RubyConf Portugal is back in 2015</h2>
    <author>Written by <a href="#">Roberto</a> on 27, Feb 2015</author>
    <p>We're ready to announce that the 2nd edition of RubyConf Portugal
    is coming and it's going to be bigger, bolder and awesome-er!
    A long time passed since the day that we decided to create the very
    first RubyConf Portugal. Since then we worked tirelessly to make
    sure that, with the first edition, we'd build the foundations for
    a consistent yearly conference about Ruby in Portugal.
    By the reactions from speakers and attendees, it seems we've hit a home run:
    <h1 class="h2-article">Where?</h1>
    The conference will again take place in the beautiful city of Braga, Portugal's
     third biggest city, with an amazing history and a fantastic University.
     It was the European Youth Capital in 2012 and it is 30 mins away from Porto,
     the coolest city of Europe. You probably already heard of it, at least about
     the Port Wine and the OPO airport (which, by the way, was also considered
     one of the best in Europe).

     Braga can be described as an ancient, historic city, filled with young people,
     determined to make a difference. We have great tech companies here, with major
     international relevance, as well as young companies and startups.

    <h1 class="h2-article">When?</h1>
    This year it will happen on September 13 to 15.
