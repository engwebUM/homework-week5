            <p>We're ready to announce that the 2nd edition of <a href="http://rubyconf.pt/">RubyConf Portugal</a> is coming and it's going to be bigger, bolder and awesome-er!</p>
            <p>A long time passed since the day that we decided to create the <a href="https://blog.groupbuddies.com/posts/31-brace-yourselves-rubyconf-portugal-is-coming">very first</a> RubyConf Portugal. Since then we worked tirelessly to make sure that, with the first edition, we'd build the foundations for a consistent yearly conference about Ruby in Portugal. By the reactions from speakers and attendees, it seems we've hit a home run.</p>
            <p>Again this year, this is an event envisioned by <a href="https://groupbuddies.com/">Group Buddies</a>, although everyone is invited to help us put it together. We want to join forces and unite the community, in order to create the best event we possibly can.</p>
            <h1>Where?</h1>
            <p>The conference will again take place in the beautiful city of Braga, Portugal's third biggest city, with an amazing history and a fantastic University. It was the European Youth Capital in 2012 and it is 30 mins away from Porto, the <a href="https://www.europeanbestdestinations.org/top/europe-best-destinations-2014">coolest city of Europe</a>. You probably already heard of it, at least about the Port Wine and the <a href="https://www.ana.pt/en-US/Topo/institucional/aboutANA/News/Neâ€¦Pages/Porto-Airport-once-again-voted-3rd-best-in-Europe.aspx">OPO airport</a>  (which, by the way, was also considered one of the best in Europe).</p>
