                    <p>
                        We're ready to announce that the 2nd edition of RubyConf 
                        Portugal is coming and it's going to be bigger, bolder 
                        and awesome-er!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A long time passed since the day that we decided to 
                        create the <a href="index.html">very first</a> RubyConf 
                        Portugal. Since then we worked tirelessly to make sure that,
                        with the first edition, we'd build the foundations for a 
                        consistent yearly conference about Ruby in Portugal. 
                        By the reactions from speakers and attendees, it seems 
                        we've hit a home run:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again this year, this is an event envisioned by 
                        <a href="index.html">Group Buddies</a>, although 
                        everyone is invited to help us put it together. We want to 
                        join forces and unite the community, in order to create the 
                        best event we possibly can.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Where?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The conference will again take place in the beautiful city 
                        of Braga, Portugal's third biggest city, with an amazing 
                        history and a fantastic University. It was the European Youth 
                        Capital in 2012 and it is 30 mins away from Porto, the 
                        <a href="index.html">coolest city of Europe</a>. You 
                        probably already heard of it, at least about the Port Wine 
                        and the <a href="index.html">OPO airport</a> (which, by 
                        the way, was also considered one of the best in Europe).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Braga can be described as an ancient, historic city, filled 
                        with young people, determined to make a difference. We have
                        great tech companies here, with major international 
                        relevance, as well as young companies and startups.
                    </p>
                    <h2>When?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This year it will happen on September 13 to 15.
                    </p>
                    <h2>CFP, Tickets, and more...</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will soon be launching the Call For Proposals and we 
                        will start selling tickets next month. Sponsors and 
                        partners are welcome, so we'd love if you could help 
                        us spread the word. We will have a team of voluntaries 
                        which you can apply for, by emailing us at 
                        <a href="index.html">rubyconfpt@groupbuddies.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are aware of the challenge that it represents to top 
                        last year's edition. Creating such an ambitious 
                        conference is far from being an easy task, but we're 
                        confident that the portuguese ruby community will again 
                        embrace this event as a way to unite itself and put 
                        Portugal on the map, not only amongst ruby conferences, 
                        but also amongst the OSS community in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>We hope to see you all this fall in Braga.</p>

                    <p>
                        I said it before and I'll say it again, several times: Automation is awesome.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I previously showed an example of how you can automate 
                        the whole <a href="index.html">process of merging pull requests</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I'd like to share another git tip that helps 
                        me speed up my workflow. This one is about <a href="index.html">git hooks</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What are git hooks?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A git hook is a script that gets triggered automatically 
                        when certain events happen (e.g. when creating a new commit). 
                        Now you're probably remembering that Github has something 
                        similar, called <a href="index.html">Webhooks</a>. Those 
                        are the things that trigger your 
                        <a href="index.html">Travis CI</a> builds every 
                        time you push a new commit (that's just one example of 
                        the many integrations Github provides).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While those are great for their purpose, git itself has
                        its own hooks that you can use to your advantage in your
                        local copy of a repository.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of the most commonly used hooks include: * 
                        <span class="bold">pre-commit</span> Triggered when you 
                        invoke git commit, but before the commit is actually 
                        created * <span class="bold">post-commit</span> Same 
                        thing, but gets triggered after the commit is created * 
                        <span class="bold">post-checkout</span> For when you 
                        use git checkout, or when the HEAD pointer changes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can see the full list in the official docs, but 
                        this gives you a good overview already.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hooks can also influence the behaviour of git itself. 
                        For instance, if a pre-commit hook exits with a non-zero 
                        status, the commit command is cancelled. This allows you
                        to define some interesting behaviour.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>How about something useful now?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now we're ready to do some hooks that actually help 
                        our workflow.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Preventing mistakes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever pushed something, only to find out 5 
                        minutes later that you forgot to remove that nasty 
                        breakpoint from the code? Or maybe you tend to push 
                        commits with small code style issues that your CI warns 
                        you about right away.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A good solution could be having a hook that looked for 
                        those mistakes, and prevented you from committing them. 
                        For a Ruby project, it could be something like this:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first function will check if your Gemfile and 
                        Gemfile.lock match each other. If you update the first 
                        one, but forget to stage the second one, that's usually 
                        a mistake. And you don't need to bother your CI server 
                        when mistakes are easily and quickly detected.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If that check passes, the script will also run your 
                        test suite.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That last detail is probably an overkill. You don't 
                        want your entire test suite to be run every time. 
                        But maybe you have a smaller subset of that, or a quick
                        tool you use for code style checks? 
                        <a href="index.html">Aaron Patterson</a> created a 
                        <a href="index.html">gist</a> that allows you to detect 
                        which specs are affected by your changes, and this is a 
                        great use case for it. Another option is to run 
                        <a href="index.html">rubocop</a> or some other code 
                        quality tool that you might have integrated in your 
                        workflow.
