							<a href="">Game On! RubyConf Portugal is back in 2015</a>
						</h1>

						<p>We're ready to announce that the 2nd edition of <a href="">RubyConf Portugal</a> is coming and it's going to be bigger, bolder and awesome-er!</p>

						<p>A long time passed since the day that we decided to create the 
							<a href="">very first</a> RubyConf Portugal. Since then we worked tirelessly to make sure that, with the first edition, we'd build the foundations for a consistent yearly conference about Ruby in Portugal. By the reactions from speakers and attendees, it seems we've hit a home run:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>It was <a href="">@rubyconfpt</a> 's first year, but you wouldn't have known. What a great conf.
							</p>- Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik) <a href="">October 15, 2014</a>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Many thanks to 
							<a href="">@groupbuddies</a>-the organizers of 
							<a href="">@rubyconfpt</a>-for creating such a special event. Hope to stay in touch with all my new friends.</p>- Erik Michaels-Ober (@sferik) 
							<a href="">October 15, 2014</a>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Again this year, this is an event envisioned by <a href="">Group Buddies</a>, although everyone is invited to help us put it together. We want to join forces and unite the community, in order to create the best event we possibly can.</p>

						<h1>Where?</h1>

						<p>The conference will again take place in the beautiful city of Braga, Portugal's third biggest city, with an amazing history and a fantastic University. It was the European Youth Capital in 2012 and it is 30 mins away from Porto, the <a href="">coolest city of Europe</a>. You probably already heard of it, at least about the Port Wine and the <a href="">OPO airport</a> (which, by the way, was also considered one of the best in Europe).</p>

						<p>Braga can be described as an ancient, historic city, filled with young people, determined to make a difference. We have great tech companies here, with major international relevance, as well as young companies and startups.</p>

						<h1>When?</h1>

						<p>This year it will happen on September 13 to 15.</p>

						<h1>CFP, Tickets, and more...</h1>

						<p>We will soon be launching the Call For Proposals and we will start selling tickets next month. Sponsors and partners are welcome, so we'd love if you could help us spread the word. We will have a team of voluntaries which you can apply for, by emailing us at <a href="">rubyconfpt@groupbuddies.com</a>.</p>

						<p>We are aware of the challenge that it represents to top last year's edition. Creating such an ambitious conference is far from being an easy task, but we're confident that the portuguese ruby community will again embrace this event as a way to unite itself and put Portugal on the map, not only amongst ruby conferences, but also amongst the OSS community in general.</p>

						<p>We hope to see you all this fall in Braga.</p>

						<p>There's only so much you can do in life. Your time is limited, as well as your focus and your energy. </p>

						<p>As a designer, it's my job to study, understand and work out the best possible solution for any particular problem.</p>

						<p>Now, I have two options: I can spend my life designing meaningless websites for copy-cat companies, focused solely on the next 'buck', and that will have no real impact in the world and our daily lives, or I can dedicate my time to design innovative and disruptive products, that intend to leave a footprint in the world.</p>

						<p>This premiss stands true for designers, developers and anyone else who aches to create products that aim to empower users and step away from meaningless projects.</p>

						<p>It's understandably challenging to feel motivated on working on an app that aims to replace Instagram or Facebook (how many of these were there? I totally lost count). You feel like you're wasting your precious time and energy on something that will never pay off intellectually, will never inspire people and doesn't even attempt to. It's dull and pointless. </p>

						<p>You should aim higher. You should expect more than financial income from your work, more than a promotion and a pat on the back. You should feel inspired by what you make, by what you put out in the world. </p>

						<p>Your time is limited.</p>

						<p><br></p>

						<h3>What can you do?</h3>

						<p>Think deeply about what excites you. What tingles your curiosity and gets you going when you're discussing it with your friends. Think of the things out there in the world right now, that perform poorly and neglect people's lives, directly or otherwise. It can be something massive, like education, health, world hunger, or something cultural but tangible, that somehow touches people, like music or literature. It can be something cool that you wish existed. </p>

						<p>There's probably a ton of things that come through your mind that you'd like to improve, that you have ideas for. You just need to focus on one that you care deeply about.  </p>

						<p><br></p>

						<h3>Where should you start?</h3>

						<p>If you can't afford to work on these kind of projects on your company, you can start on your own free time. If you don't have the full skill set needed to develop it, you can always seek help from people that relate to your idea. </p>

						<p>Sites like <a href="">CollabFinder</a> or <a href="">Meeet</a> are a great place to search for collaborators or even to look for some interesting projects that might grab your attention and require your skills. </p>

						<p>There's plenty of people working around mediocrity already and they're very successful at it. They don't need your help for that. Start something new, break some stuff. No one will notice you until you stretch out of your comfort zone.</p>

						<p><br></p>

						<h3>When is the right time?</h3>

						<p>You know those people who say 'It's never too late'? - They're wrong.</p>

						<p>Do it now, while there's still time. While you've got the energy, the will and the determination to do it. Work on something that makes you proud, that makes you feel useful. The weight of responsibility will rest on your shoulders, it will use up your energy and drive your focus but... wasn't that the exact same feeling that led you to do what you do in the first place? </p>

						<p><br></p>

						<p><em>P.S. If you're looking for a change of pace and want to work with people that are passionate about making great digital products, you should know that we're hiring one 
							<a href="">designer</a> and one 
							<a href="">developer</a>.
						Also, if you're still new to the web but you're eager to learn and love a good challenge, you should check out our 
						<a href="">Apprenticeship Program</a>.</em></p>
